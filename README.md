# Chess-Engine


## Introduction
This Chess engine is an independent passion project designed to explore the applications of search algorithms in Chess. The program creates an interactive, turn-based GUI that allows for casual play and analysis of games with alpha-beta pruning.

## To-do
* Create a visual list of captured pieces
* Transition the search algorithm to a deep-learning algorithm
* make the game window scalable

## Technologies
* Java 8
* Java Swing
* Java FX

## Setup and Launch
Since the project is written entirely in Java, simply download the project folder, ensure JDK 8 is downloaded, and compile the src files to create executables for the game. Run the main class, with the command ``` Java gui ``` to run create the GUI.
